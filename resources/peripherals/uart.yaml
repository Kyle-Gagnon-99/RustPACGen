            Transmitter FIFO Nearly Full continuous status:
            This indicates that there is not enough space for the number of bytes currently specified in the WSIZE bits in the Mode register.
            If a write were currently attempted it would cause an overflow.
            0: More than one byte is unused in the Tx FIFO
            1: Only one byte is free in the Tx FIFO
